Seller Performance: Incubation Phase Analysis

In this project, I analyze seller performance during the Incubation Phase using a real dataset from a major Brazilian e-commerce platform (Olist):

Through a combination of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), cohort retention, time-to-first-order analysis, and seller segmentation, this project aims to uncover:

1. The factors that determine time-to-first order

2. Retention rate analysis after first order (Incubation phase)

I hope this portfolio can serve as a strong proof of my dedication, analytical capability, and domain knowledge in the e-commerce ecosystem.

Through this project, I aim to demonstrate my understanding of how platforms like Shopee operate—from seller onboarding and activation, to incubation, retention, and performance management.
